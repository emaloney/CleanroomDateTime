### Swift 2.0 compatibility

The `master` branch of this project is Swift 2.0 compliant and therefore **requires Xcode 7.0 or higher to compile**.


### License

CleanroomDateTime is provided for your use—free-of-charge—on an as-is basis. We make no guarantees, promises or apologies. *Caveat developer.*


### Adding CleanroomDateTime to your project

[![Carthage compatible](https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-compatible-4BC51D.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage)

You’ll need to [integrate CleanroomDateTime into your project](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomDateTime/blob/master/INTEGRATION.md) in order to use [the API](https://rawgit.com/emaloney/CleanroomDateTime/master/Documentation/index.html) it provides. You can choose:

- [Manual integration](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomDateTime/blob/master/INTEGRATION.md#manual-integration), wherein you embed CleanroomDateTime’s Xcode project within your own, **_or_**
- [Using the Carthage dependency manager](https://github.com/emaloney/CleanroomDateTime/blob/master/INTEGRATION.md#carthage-integration) to build a framework that you then embed in your application.
 
Once integrated, just add the following `import` statement to any Swift file where you want to use CleanroomDateTime:

```swift
import CleanroomDateTime
```

For detailed information on using CleanroomDateTime, [API documentation](https://rawgit.com/emaloney/CleanroomDateTime/master/Documentation/index.html) is available.


## About

The Cleanroom Project began as an experiment to re-imagine Gilt’s iOS codebase in a legacy-free incarnation that embraced the latest Apple technology. Since then, Cleanroom Project code has served as the basis of Gilt’s tvOS app, [featured by Apple during the keynote](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/september-2015/) introducing the App Store for Apple TV.

We’ll be tracking the latest releases of Swift and Xcode, and we’ll be [open-sourcing major portions of our code](https://github.com/gilt/Cleanroom#open-source-by-default) as we go.

CleanroomDateTime is in active development, and we welcome your contributions.
